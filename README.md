# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
The project was created to allow a very basic approach to learning how to code, how all (again at a very basic level) the elements work together such as the foundations and then interactive. We learned about the framework, if statements, for, arrays, loops, obviously this makes us no subject matter expert but gives a better understanding of the material by putting it into practice.

## Usage
The Prework Study Guide has multiple sections on its screen. Within each section are notes related to the topic under which it stands. Topics include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I also recommend checking out the DevTools console to see the runnung script.
